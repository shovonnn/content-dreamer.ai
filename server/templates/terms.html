    <h1>Conversation Coach AI – Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Conversation Coach AI application and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account, accessing, installing, or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>Conversation Coach AI helps users record (where permitted), upload, transcribe, analyze, and receive AI‑generated coaching guidance on spoken conversations such as sales calls, discovery meetings, and practice sessions. Guidance is suggestive and for informational and training purposes only; you remain solely responsible for decisions you make in real engagements.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have the authority to enter into these Terms. You may not use the Service if you are barred by applicable law, or if previously suspended or removed.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration & Security</h2>
    <p>You must provide accurate information and maintain the security of your credentials. You are responsible for all activity under your account. Promptly notify us of any unauthorized use or suspected compromise.</p>

    <h2>4. Recording & Consent Responsibilities</h2>
    <p><strong>You are solely responsible for obtaining all legally required consents before recording or uploading any conversation.</strong> Laws on call and meeting recording vary by jurisdiction (one‑party vs. all‑party consent). You agree not to use the Service to record or process audio where you lack lawful authority or consent.</p>

    <h2>5. User Content</h2>
    <p>"User Content" includes audio, transcripts, notes, tags, and feedback you submit. You retain ownership of User Content, subject to the rights you grant us below.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, process, transcribe, analyze, and generate derivative coaching outputs from your User Content solely to provide and improve the Service.</li>
        <li>Where permitted by law and only if you opt in, anonymized and aggregated data may be used to enhance models, quality, and features. You can withdraw future use via settings (withdrawal does not delete prior aggregated results).</li>
        <li>You represent that your User Content does not infringe rights of third parties or violate law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upload or process unlawful, defamatory, abusive, or discriminatory content;</li>
        <li>Attempt to re‑identify anonymized data;</li>
        <li>Use outputs as definitive legal, medical, or financial advice;</li>
        <li>Interfere with security, integrity, rate limits, or infrastructure;</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer underlying models except as allowed by law;</li>
        <li>Misrepresent AI‑generated suggestions as verbatim statements from humans;</li>
        <li>Use the Service to train competing foundational models without written permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service (excluding User Content) including software, UI, branding, and underlying models are owned or licensed by us and protected by intellectual property laws. Except for limited rights expressly granted, no license is implied.</p>

    <h2>8. Coaching Outputs & Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>AI summaries, scores, and coaching suggestions may be incomplete, imprecise, or contextually inappropriate. They are not a substitute for professional judgment. You should independently validate critical information. We do not guarantee accuracy, fitness, or suitability.</p>

    <h2>9. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third‑party infrastructure (e.g., cloud hosting, AI model providers, messaging APIs). Their use is subject to their terms, and we are not liable for their independent acts or omissions.</p>

    <h2>10. Beta & Experimental Features</h2>
    <p>Certain features may be labeled Beta or Experimental and may change, be rate‑limited, or discontinued without liability.</p>

    <h2>11. Fees & Payment (If Applicable)</h2>
    <p>Paid plans, if offered, will be described at purchase. You authorize recurring charges for subscription tiers until cancellation pursuant to plan terms. Taxes may apply. Except where required by law, fees are non‑refundable.</p>

    <h2>12. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Audio and transcripts are retained to provide the Service and improve personalized coaching. You may request deletion of specific recordings (which will remove associated transcripts and derived coaching artifacts, except anonymized aggregate analytics already produced). Backups may persist for a limited period.</p>

    <h2>13. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use is also governed by our Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference. In the event of conflict, these Terms control with respect to contractual rights.</p>

    <h2>14. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure and we disclaim absolute security guarantees.</p>

    <h2>15. Suspension & Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access for suspected policy violations, legal risk, or security concerns. Upon termination, your license ends and we may delete associated data (subject to legal retention obligations).</p>

    <h2>16. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, non‑infringement, availability, or error‑free operation.</p>

    <h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law: (a) we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; (b) our aggregate liability for all claims in any 12‑month period is limited to the greater of (i) amounts paid by you in that period or (ii) USD $50. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations—those limits apply only to the extent permitted.</p>

    <h2>18. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You will defend and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees, and agents against third‑party claims arising from (a) your User Content; (b) violation of law or these Terms; (c) recording without required consent.</p>

    <h2>19. Export & Compliance</h2>
    <p>You represent you are not located in a prohibited jurisdiction or on a restricted list and will not export or re‑export the Service in violation of applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>20. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms. Material changes will be posted with an updated date. Continued use after effectiveness constitutes acceptance. If you object, discontinue use.</p>

    <h2>21. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Unless prohibited by local law, these Terms are governed by the laws applicable where the service operator is established, excluding conflict rules. The parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue of competent courts in that location.</p>

    <h2>22. Severability & Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement superseding prior understandings regarding the Service.</p>
