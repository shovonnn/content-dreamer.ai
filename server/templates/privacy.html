    <h1>Conversation Coach AI – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Conversation Coach AI ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use our application and related services (the "Service") that enable recording (where lawful), transcription, analysis, and AI‑generated coaching guidance for spoken conversations.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Name, email, authentication identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversation Audio (User Content):</strong> Audio you upload or record using the app, subject to your responsibility for consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcripts & Derived Data:</strong> Text transcriptions, timestamps, speaker segmentation (if available), sentiment metrics, topic tags, coaching insights, and scoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage & Technical Data:</strong> Feature usage events, crash logs, diagnostics, device type, OS version, IP‑derived approximate region, session timing.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Data (If Subscribed):</strong> Limited billing metadata (handled by our PCI‑compliant processor; we do not store full card numbers).</li>
        <li><strong>Support Communications:</strong> Messages or attachments you send to support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Lawful Basis (Where Applicable)</h2>
    <p>We process personal data based on: (a) contract performance (providing the Service); (b) legitimate interests (improving quality, security, preventing abuse); (c) consent (optional analytics model improvement, certain notifications); (d) legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Deliver core features: recording, transcription, analysis, coaching suggestions.</li>
        <li>Maintain and improve accuracy, performance, and user experience.</li>
        <li>Personalize insights and recommend conversation improvements.</li>
        <li>Detect abuse, security threats, and policy violations.</li>
        <li>Operate backups, redundancy, and disaster recovery.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal requests and enforce Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>With opt‑in: use anonymized & aggregated data to refine models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Recording Consent Responsibility</h2>
    <p><strong>You are solely responsible for obtaining consent from all required parties before recording or uploading audio.</strong> We do not monitor conversations in real time and cannot guarantee your compliance with regional recording laws.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Minimization & Anonymization</h2>
    <p>Where feasible, we pseudonymize or aggregate analytical derivatives (e.g., sentiment averages). De‑identification is not guaranteed irreversible.</p>

    <h2>6. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Cloud hosting, AI model inference, logging, email, notification and payment processors under contractual confidentiality.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal & Safety:</strong> To comply with applicable law, valid legal process, or to protect rights, safety, or integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transactions:</strong> In mergers, acquisitions, financing, or asset transfers (with continuity safeguards).</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated Insights:</strong> Non‑identifiable statistics may be published (e.g., average call length) without disclosing personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Audio and transcripts are retained while your account is active or as needed for service delivery. You may delete specific recordings which queues associated transcripts and derived coaching metrics for removal (subject to lawful retention, anti‑fraud, or backup latency). Backups cycle on a rolling schedule.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We employ encryption in transit (TLS), restricted access controls, environment segmentation, monitoring, and least‑privilege practices. No system is perfectly secure; residual risk remains.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data may be processed in jurisdictions different from your own. We implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses where applicable).</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, port data, or withdraw consent. Exercise by contacting: <a href="mailto:privacy@conversationcoach.ai">privacy@conversationcoach.ai</a>. We will verify identity before fulfilling requests. Certain data (e.g., logs, security copies) may be restricted or delayed if deletion conflicts with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>11. Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 16 (or higher local minimum). We do not knowingly collect such data. If obtained inadvertently, we will delete upon notice.</p>

    <h2>12. Third‑Party Links</h2>
    <p>External links or integrations are governed by their own privacy practices. Review their policies independently.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be posted with a revised date. Continued use after the effective date indicates acceptance.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact</h2>
    <p>Privacy inquiries: <a href="mailto:privacy@conversationcoach.ai">privacy@conversationcoach.ai</a>. General support: <a href="mailto:support@conversationcoach.ai">support@conversationcoach.ai</a>.</p>
